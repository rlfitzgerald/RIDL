# RIDL

The Real Time Interrogation of Data through Language (RIDL) project aims to removes friction from complex data analytics. RIDL enables an analyst to perform complex data analytics without needing to become familiar with the numerous obtuse or cumbersome tools that are typically associated with similar tasks. By leveraging the Natural Language Processing power of COTS hardware, we have been able to create a system that uses a well known and intuitive interface -- natural language -- as an abstracted query language. Instead of forcing an analyst to make many complex SQL queries to a massive relational database, format the desired data, and create a graphical front end, RIDL simply waits for the user to ask it a question about some data. RIDL then does all of the heavy lifting for you. Gaining insight is now as simple as asking the right questions.
